# Wind fetch

Wind fetch is an important measurement in coastal applications. It provides a measurement for the unobstructed length of water over which wind from a certain direction can blow over. The higher the wind fetch from a certain direction, the more energy is imparted onto the surface of the water resulting in a larger sea state. Therefore, the larger the fetch, the larger the exposure to wind and the more likely the site experiences larger sea states.

# Why **windfetch**?

Averaging the wind fetch for numerous directions at the same location is a reasonable measure of the overall wind exposure. The process of manually calculating wind fetch can be extremely time-consuming and tedious, particularly if a large number of fetch vectors are required at many locations. The **windfetch** package calculates wind fetch for any marine location on Earth. There are also plot methods to help visualise the wind exposure at the various locations, and the ability to output the fetch vectors to a shape file for further investigation.

# Installation

You can install and load the latest version of **windfetch** from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes))
  install.packages("remotes")

# Install windfetch
remotes::install_github("blasee/windfetch")
```

```{r}
# Load the windfetch and sf package
library(windfetch)
library(sf)

# Read a shapefile of the North Carolina coastline
nc = st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE)

# Create an sf geometry
ncg = st_geometry(nc)

# Project the coastline using the NAD83 projection
nc_proj = st_transform(ncg, "epsg:32119")

# Create a dataframe of the sites to calculate wind fetch at
sites_df = data.frame(lon = c(-76, -76, -77.3),
                      lat = c(36, 35.3, 34.5))

# Include spatial reference information by transforming to an sf object
sites_points = st_as_sf(sites_df, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = "epsg:4326")

# Project the points onto the same projection as the coastline
sites_points_proj = st_transform(sites_points, "epsg:32119")
```

# Calculating wind fetch with the **windfetch** package

If you already have an `sf` polygon object representing the coastline and 
surrounding islands, and an `sf` points object representing the locations, 
then calculating wind fetch with **windfetch** is easy. You can just pass these
two arguments into the `windfetch()` function.

```{r, fig.cap="Map showing the land polygon layer (filled grey polygons) and point geometries representing the site locations."}
plot(ncg, col = "lightgrey", border = "grey")
plot(sites_points, pch = "x", add = TRUE)
text(st_coordinates(sites_points), labels = paste("Site", 1:3), pos = 3)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate wind fetch by passing in the projected sf polygons object (nc_proj)
# and the projected points object (sites_points_proj) to the windfetch function.
my_fetch_proj = windfetch(nc_proj, sites_points_proj, progress_bar = FALSE)

summary(my_fetch_proj)
```

The `my_fetch_proj` object provides a summary of the fetch for all the four 
quadrants, along with an average of the fetch length at all the sites.

# Visualise the fetch vectors

## Projected space

```{r}
# Plot the fetch vectors and the coastline in the projected space
plot(my_fetch_proj, axes = TRUE)
plot(nc_proj, col = "lightgrey", border = "grey", add = TRUE)
```

## Unprojected latitude and longitude space

```{r}
# Transform the CRS back to lats and longs
my_fetch_latlon = crs_transform(my_fetch_proj, "epsg:4326")

# Plot the fetch vectors and the coastline in lat lon space
plot(my_fetch_latlon, axes = TRUE)
plot(ncg, col = "lightgrey", border = "grey", add = TRUE)
```

# Export to an ESRI shape file

```{r}
# Transform the fetch object to an sf object
my_fetch_sf = as_sf(my_fetch_latlon)
my_fetch_sf
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Export the fetch vectors to an ESRI shape file for further investigation
st_write(nc_fetch_sf, "nc_fetch.shp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```
